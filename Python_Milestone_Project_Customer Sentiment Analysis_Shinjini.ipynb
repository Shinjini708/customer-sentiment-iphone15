    "## 💡 Recommendations\n",

    "Based on my sentiment analysis of 300 customer reviews for the iPhone 15 (128GB, Blue) on Flipkart, I propose the following actionable recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leverage Positive Sentiment in Marketing**  \n",
    "  The overall average polarity score is high, indicating strong customer satisfaction. Most reviews are highly positive about the camera quality, smooth performance, and display. These strengths should be highlighted in promotional campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Real Customer Quotes**  \n",
    "  Several first-sentence highlights from reviews are short, positive, and persuasive. Including these customer phrases in product banners or social media ads can enhance credibility and drive conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve Delivery and Packaging Communication**  \n",
    "  The few negative reviews mention issues around delivery experience and packaging. Flipkart can consider enhancing buyer communication post-purchase, including proactive updates and quality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encourage Reviews with Sentiment Anchoring**  \n",
    "  Since the majority of reviews were subjective, Flipkart could nudge users to mention specific features (camera, battery, design) in reviews. This could improve the quality of insights and help future buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, customer sentiment is strongly positive. The product is well-received, and minor improvements in logistics or service communication can push the sentiment even higher."
